# Obsidian Auto Template From Filename
This is an edited code from:

https://github.com/ljavuras/obsidian-power-tools/tree/main/Filename%20Template

I had trouble making it work, I had to fork and edit the code a bit.

Follow the steps in from the link above but use my version of filename_template.md

# What does it do?
This makes a hierarchy like Dendron. You make a root word, like "house". Now everytime you make a "house." file, it will automatically use the provided template. So "house.bob", would automatically add the specified template.

# obsidian auto-template-from-file-name
This is an edited code from:

https://github.com/ljavuras/obsidian-power-tools/tree/main/Filename%20Template

I had trouble making it work, I had to fork and edit the code a bit.

Follow the steps in from the link above but use my version of filename_template.md
